# Silly Smile Sim
## Matt Jaquiery and Olly Robertson
### Created 10/07/2020

## Introduction

Olly and co collect lots of exciting facial expression data from prisoner's dilemma games, but it can be quite tricky to figure out an appropriate analytical approach. This project simulates slightly less (or more) exciting expression data for testing analytical approaches on.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is directly from GitHub using remotes:

```r
remotes::install_github('mjaquiery/silly-smile-sim')
```
